-Validation for T4 failed-

-Conclusion
All commits made by me must be and will be
validated. Test 3 encryption still in question. 
I had to enter PASS for commit regardless.


On commit, -s no longer required and -se is redundant (So far)

*Note Bugs on wrong PASS*
Text line stays blank for all commands after incorrect PASS.
